 Define Operators or Functions: Addition,Subtraction,Multiplication, and Division
# Addition

    return n1 + n2
# Subtraction
def subtraction(n1,n2):

# Multiplication
def multiplication(n1,n2):

# Division
def division(n1,n2):
    return n1 / n2
print("Select Operations")
print ("1. Addition\n "
       "2. Subtraction\n"
       "3. Multiplication\n"
       "4. Division\n")

# Giving the option to the user to choose the operation

operation=int(input("Enter choice of operation 1/2/3/4:"))

# taking input from the Users

n1 = float(input("Enter the First Number:"))
n2 = float(input("Enter the Second Number:"))

# Apply onditional Statements: To make operation as-per-user choices

if operation == 1:

elif operation == 2:
